# Readme.md : Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project




## Purpose:
- Demostrate the ability to collect, work with and create a tidy data set

## Course Project Focus:
- Task1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Task2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
- Task3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Task4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
- Task5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Steps to run the project
- 1. Download and unzip the data source locally. The data will appear in a folder titled "UCI HAR Dataset"
- 2. In Rstudio open the "run_analysis.R" script file and set the working directory as the parent directory of "UCI HAR Dataset"
- 3. Use source("run_analysis.R") to generated and write out a file called "tidydata.csv" in the working directory
- 4. All dependencies are reflected in the script file and all tasks are clearly identified
